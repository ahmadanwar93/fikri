## Introduction

This idea came to me when I realized I have spent a lot of time writing down my to-do lists in my journal every day. It is still a practice that I love doing every day. But I am exploring: can I code my own to-do list? The biggest hurdle for me in writing my own to-do list is that some of the tasks are not tied to a particular day, for example, reading an interesting article I found online. Of course it is trivial in nature with the problem at hand, but this is an outlet for me to explore.

The repository is at:

1. [Backend repo](https://github.com/ahmadanwar93/task-management-backend)
2. [Frontend repo](https://github.com/ahmadanwar93/task-management-frontend)

I will update the release as I go.

## First Release

Date: 2025-11-11

The goal of the first release is to produce an MVP that:

1. Allow user to create workspace
2. Allow user to create and edit sprints
3. Allow user to create and edit tasks

I will proceed with deployment next.
