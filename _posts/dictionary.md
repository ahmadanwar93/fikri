## Introduction

This is my first taste of designing a web app from scratch. The idea is to use the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to get the definition and display it. The goal is to learn how designers think to empathize with them more.

The landing page I designed:

## Thoughts

I learned quite fast that designing is hard. It takes time and experience. I have to consider aspects like accessibility while still not sacrificing the aesthetics of it. I wish I had more time and guidance to complete this.

Looking back, I think the font pairing can be improved considering the font weight. Maybe I have to learn more.
