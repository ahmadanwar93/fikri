## Introduction

This visualisation is just a fun project with a friend of mine, Ren. We were trying to see and visualise the time taken between LRT stops. We were curious about how far and how wide the variation of travel times between stations is.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this piece comes from design systems. In a design system, designers list down the font families, sizes, and colors that match the brand. I used that as a guideline and played around with color and font size in this piece.
